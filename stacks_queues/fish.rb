# two non-empty arrays A and B consisting of N integers
# fish are numbered from 0 to N âˆ’ 1
# Fish number P is represented by A[P] and B[P]. Array A contains the sizes of the fish. All its elements are unique.
# Array B contains the directions of the fish. It contains only 0s and/or 1s, where:
# 0 represents a fish flowing upstream,
# 1 represents a fish flowing downstream.
#         N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
#         each element of array A is an integer within the range [0..1,000,000,000];
#         each element of array B is an integer that can have one of the following values: 0, 1;
#         the elements of A are all distinct.
# Stack level too deep on one test case..
